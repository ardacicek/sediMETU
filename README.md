Developed by Yagiz Arda Cicek, â’¸ 2021 in METU using the formulas obtained from Soulsby, 1997.
You can switch between Current, Wave, and Current+Wave modes using the tabs at the top. Fill the input section with known parameters and hit "Calculate!".

NOTE: If you get "Windows protected your PC" error, click on "More info" and press "Run anyway". This error is caused by lack of certification/sign (too expensive to buy, sorry).
